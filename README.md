# Orchestrina

A homebrew Ocarina allowing you to play songs from many Zelda games. Also has a free play mode. Requires sf2dlib, sfillib, sftdlib, and portlibs to build.

### Installation:
Build using devKitPro. Place orcherina.3dsx, orcherina.smdh, and sd_data/ into sdmc:/3ds/orcherina. Rename sd_data/ to data/. Launch with your launcher of choice. Laugh at how terribly the app works.
