# Orchestrina

A homebrew Ocarina allowing you to play songs from many Zelda games. Also has a free play mode. Requires sf2dlib, sfillib, sftdlib, and portlibs to build.

### Installation
Build using devKitPro or download compiled release. Place orcherina.3dsx, orcherina.smdh, and data/ into sdmc:/3ds/orcherina. Launch with your launcher of choice. Laugh at how terribly the app works.
